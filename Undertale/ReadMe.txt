In order for this to work, you need to open undertale.port in the folder you get from PortMaster and move all gamedata from Steam to where it should go. 
You can find that in the listing for Undertale at https://portmaster.games/

Once undertale.port looks as it should, add the script to ports/ and you should be good to go.
